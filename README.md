## **Project Overview**

**[View Figma Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/5pa2aiogIVuTwyIL0iREJ7/Milk-Distribution-System?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=63-904&viewport=11966%2C-16430%2C0.85&t=rsmDYDYtpEA3a3AT-1&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=1%3A604&show-proto-sidebar=1)**


This project focuses on designing a mobile application UI/UX solution for controlling various home appliances such as Fans, Air Conditioners, TVs, Lights, and Bulbs. The objective is to create a user-friendly interface that allows users to manage their home appliances directly from a listing screen. The design includes multiple options for controlling functionalities like ON/OFF, temperature adjustment, fan speed control, brightness adjustment, and color changes for lights.

## **Figma Prototype**

The UI/UX design was created using Figma, and the following link provides access to the prototype in viewing mode. The prototype demonstrates the layout, controls, and interaction flow of the application:



### **Features Included:**
1. **Appliance Listing**: A screen that lists all types of appliances with icons and labels for easy identification.
2. **ON/OFF Control**: Toggle switches for turning appliances on or off.
3. **Temperature Control**: A slider for adjusting the temperature of the air conditioner.
4. **Fan Speed Control**: A slider for controlling the speed of the fan.
5. **Brightness Adjustment**: A slider to adjust the brightness of lights and bulbs.
6. **Color Change**: A color picker for changing the color of the lights.

### **Design Variations:**
The prototype includes multiple design variations to explore different approaches to the layout and control mechanisms.
